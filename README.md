# JavaScript Clock

A clock made with JavaScript!

This is a HTML page, that ultilizes JavaScript embedded within the HTML page to create a clock.

I also used CSS to style the page to give the clock a nice look for the user. 

The CSS is also embedded within the HTML page.

Here is how the clock looks:
